# PokeMMO: The Senlocke
A list of rules Sentor is using for his PokeMMO Senlocke. <br> This is similar to a Nuzlocke, but follows slightly different rules which are detailed in the table below. <br> Using his main account to catch and train each Pokémon, Sen will transfer them to his alternate (alt) account for use in the challenge.
| **Rule** | **Details** |
|:-:|-|
| **Water Mono-type** | Only Water type Pokémon are available to be used. This can be either primary or secondary typing, or evolve into a water type. |
| **New Starter** | The starter Pokémon must be caught again. |
| **Add 1 Per Badge** | A new Pokémon must be added to the team for every badge obtained. |
| **Catch & Send** | Sen must catch and train each Pokémon on his main account, then transfer it for use on the alt account. |
| **Hardcore** | No reviving Pokémon. Once they are fainted, they must be placed in the graveyard box. |
| **Replacing** | After a Pokémon has fainted, it may either be **replaced with the same species** or Sen can **choose a different Pokémon to use instead**. |
| **No Dupes** | Sen cannot have two of the same species of Pokémon available for use at once. This rule is applicable for all regions. |
| **Death Counter** | All fainted Pokémon must be recorded. |
