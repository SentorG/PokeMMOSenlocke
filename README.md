# PokeMMO: The Senlocke
A list of rules Sentor is using for his PokeMMO Senlocke. <br> This is similar to a Nuzlocke, but follows slightly different rules which are detailed in the table below. <br> Using his main account to catch and train each Pokémon, Sen will transfer them to his alternate (alt) account for use in the challenge.

| **Catch & Send** | Sen must catch and train each Pokémon on his main account, then transfer it for use on the alt account. |
| **Sugar Daddy** | Items may be purchased from the main account and transferred for use on the alt account. |
